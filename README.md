# N_Queens
## Side project for 42 to learn Recursive Backtracking (My Idea/Not a project)
Note that this repository is purely for educational purposes!

- The problem: Must place 4 queen pieces on a 4x4 board. The issue is that the queens paths cannot overlap.
- The answer: Using recursive backtracking the algorithm will place pieces untill it finds a spot it cannot place a piece.
              It will back track untill solved or failed.
